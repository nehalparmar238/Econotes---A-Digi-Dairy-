Econotes — Your Digital Diary

Hey there! I’m Nehal Parmar, and this is my small Python project called Econotes — a digital diary that lets you write, read, and protect your personal notes right from your terminal
What This Project Does

Password Protected — keeps your notes private

Write Notes — save your thoughts anytime

Read Notes — read your notes by date or just today’s entry

Auto Save — everything goes into one diary file

Simple UI — text-based and beginner-friendly

How To Run This Project

Download or clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/nehalparmar238/Econotes---A-Digi-Dairy-.git


Open the folder in VS Code (or any IDE you like).

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

In the terminal, type:

python main_menu.py


If it’s your first time, the app will ask you to set a password.
Then you can start writing your diary entries right away 📝

Files Explained
File	Description
main_menu.py	The main program that runs everything
password_system.py	Handles password creation and verification
note_writer.py	Saves your diary entries
note_reader.py	Reads your saved notes
diary.txt	Stores all your written notes
password.txt	Stores your password hash (encrypted)
Why I Built This

I made Econotes while learning Python — to practice file handling, importing modules, and simple logic structures.
It’s my first mini project that actually works (and feels kinda cool to use ).

 Future Ideas

Change password option

Search notes by keyword

Delete or edit entries

Add mood tracking (happy/sad/neutral)

Save entries in a database
